# Welcome to my "bubble sorting" test chamber

I tried this algorithm a couple of times, didn't understand it at all...
Then tried some more, went through it in the debugger. And 2 days later, it clicked.

*'My final test, and the only one noteworthy is:** `TRUE_BUBBLE_SORT.py`

Video i watched:

- [Intro to Sorting Algorithms in Python - Bubble Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLvH6yi5YYU)

What i learned:

- Bubble sorting algoritm
- New way of working with nested for loops. *They are still wierd ðŸ˜µ*
- How to debugg to better understand code ðŸ˜Š
